# GUI Managers

The [src/scripts/gui/](mdc:src/scripts/gui) directory contains modules responsible for managing the main desktop UI components.

## Key Files
- [windowManager.js](mdc:src/scripts/gui/windowManager.js): Manages OS-style windows, including creation, focus, movement, and resizing.
- [startMenuManager.js](mdc:src/scripts/gui/startMenuManager.js): Handles the Start menu UI and interactions.
- [desktopManager.js](mdc:src/scripts/gui/desktopManager.js): Manages desktop icons, wallpaper, and desktop-level events.
- [taskbarManager.js](mdc:src/scripts/gui/taskbarManager.js): Manages the taskbar, running apps, and system tray.

## Usage
- These managers are imported by [main.js](mdc:src/scripts/main.js) and coordinate the overall desktop simulation.
- App modules interact with these managers via events or shared utilities.

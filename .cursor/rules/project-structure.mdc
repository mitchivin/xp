# Project Structure Guide

This project simulates a Windows XP environment as a portfolio site. The main entry point is [index.html](mdc:index.html), which loads the desktop UI, boot/login sequence, and core scripts.

## Key Directories and Files

- [index.html](mdc:index.html): Main entry point, loads the desktop, boot, and login screens, and initializes the simulation.
- [scripts/main.js](mdc:scripts/main.js): Main JavaScript entry, initializes core UI components, event bus, and CRT effects.
- [styles/main.css](mdc:styles/main.css): Main stylesheet, imports shared and GUI-specific CSS.
- [assets/](mdc:assets): Contains images, sounds, and GUI assets for the simulation.
- [docs/ISSUES.md](mdc:docs/ISSUES.md): Contains implementation notes, known issues, and UI conventions for apps.

## Apps

- All app modules are located in [apps/](mdc:apps), each in its own subdirectory (e.g., [about-me](mdc:apps/about-me), [notepad](mdc:apps/notepad)).
- Each app typically contains:
  - [index.html](mdc:apps/about-me/index.html): App entry point, loaded in an iframe by the main OS window.
  - [style.css](mdc:apps/about-me/style.css): App-specific styles, following conventions in [ISSUES.md](mdc:docs/ISSUES.md).
  - [script.js](mdc:apps/about-me/script.js): App logic, imports shared utilities from [scripts/utils/](mdc:scripts/utils).
  - [assets/](mdc:apps/about-me/assets): App-specific images or resources.

## Shared Utilities

- [scripts/utils/boot.js](mdc:scripts/utils/boot.js): Handles boot animation, login, and session state.
- [scripts/utils/menuBar.js](mdc:scripts/utils/menuBar.js): Shared menu bar logic for all apps.
- [scripts/utils/toolbar.js](mdc:scripts/utils/toolbar.js): Shared toolbar logic for all apps.
- [scripts/utils/common.js](mdc:scripts/utils/common.js): Shared actions (e.g., window exit) for all apps.

## Styles

- [styles/](mdc:styles): Main and utility CSS files for the OS UI.
- [styles/gui/](mdc:styles/gui): GUI-specific styles (windows, taskbar, start menu, etc.).
- [styles/utils/](mdc:styles/utils): Utility and effect styles (CRT, reset, boot, login, etc.).

## Assets

- [assets/gui/](mdc:assets/gui): Desktop backgrounds, icons, and GUI images.
- [assets/sounds/](mdc:assets/sounds): System sounds (e.g., login.wav).

## Conventions

- All app scripts use `type="module"` and import shared utilities.
- Menu bars and toolbars in apps use the shared setup functions from [scripts/utils/](mdc:scripts/utils).
- App CSS and structure should follow the guidelines in [docs/ISSUES.md](mdc:docs/ISSUES.md) for pixel-perfect UI and consistent menu/toolbar behavior.

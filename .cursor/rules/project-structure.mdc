# Project Structure Guide

This project is organized as follows:

- The main entry point is [index.html](mdc:index.html).
- Source code is located in the [src](mdc:src) directory, which contains:
  - [apps](mdc:src/apps): Individual application modules (e.g., media-player, notepad, etc.)
  - [scripts](mdc:src/scripts): Main logic and utility scripts, including [main.js](mdc:src/scripts/main.js)
  - [styles](mdc:src/styles): CSS and style utilities, including [main.css](mdc:src/styles/main.css)
- Static assets are in the [assets](mdc:assets) directory (apps, sounds, gui, etc.)
- Documentation is in the [docs](mdc:docs) directory, including [README.md](mdc:docs/README.md) and [ISSUES.md](mdc:docs/ISSUES.md)

All rules should reference files using the `[filename](mdc:filename)` format as shown above.

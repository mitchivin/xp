# Assets Organization

The [assets/](mdc:assets) directory contains all static resources for the desktop simulation and app modules.

## Subdirectories
- [gui/](mdc:assets/gui): GUI-related images and icons (taskbar, start menu, desktop, components, boot, fonts).
- [sounds/](mdc:assets/sounds): System sounds (e.g., login, notifications).
- [apps/](mdc:assets/apps): App-specific assets (if any).

## Usage
- GUI and system assets are referenced by core scripts and styles for authentic Windows XP visuals and sounds.
- App modules may reference assets from this directory or include their own in their subfolders.
